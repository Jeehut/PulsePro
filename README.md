# Pulse (DEPRECATED)

> **DEPRECATED**. The frameworks are now openly available at https://github.com/kean/Pulse. The macOS app will be distributed separately.

This repo contains a package manifest for [Pulse](https://github.com/kean/Pulse). For installation and usage instructions see [Pulse README](https://github.com/kean/Pulse).

Please don't put this manifest in an openly accessible location just yet. If you need access to this manifest on your CI and only your private account have access, feel free to copy the manifest.
